## 🧠 How It Works

1. Select a story genre and visual art style.
2. Google Gemini generates a cinematic story scene, an image prompt, and three branching choices using structured JSON.
3. Pollinations AI creates an illustration for the current scene.
4. Microsoft Edge TTS converts the narration into spoken audio.
5. Choosing an option sends the decision back to Gemini, allowing the story to continue while maintaining context.
